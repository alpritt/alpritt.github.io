One thing I'm looking at is to put more purpose or awareness into the kinds of thought process I have.

For example, when I'm reading a book it is easy to trick yourself into believing you are doing it to learn something. However, often you would be better off spending a fraction of the time approaching it as a more serious learning exercise and then spend more time on entertainment. Othertimes, reading more casually allows one to explore more content seeking out gems. But in those cases, it may require stopping an activity when a gem is found or trying to capture a thought so that it can be explored later. The point of all this is that there is no point putting moderate effort into learning something that you are likely to forget when what you really need at the time is entertainment or quiet. By being aware of how different approaches to thinking will affect us in the moment, medium and long term we open options to changing our approach to something more appropriate.

1. something to motivate
2. something learn
3. something to entertain
4. something to explore openmindedly

For example, at the moment I'm developing an interest in the maker space. So people who create things (models, gadgets, furniture). That's a broad field and there is a lot to learn. But I don't need to learn most of it because I'm not going to do it. But it has an impact on me. By going in with an explorer mindset I'm finding out what is possible and getting inspired. It's a little entertaining, but the inspiration has an affect on me that could encourage me to make something. Or at times it may overwhelm me by giving me too many ideas that I will never have time to explore. I'm learning, but there is no point me learning too many details until I have something in mind I want to build (if I decide to). But the fundamentals may be more worth my while because they can be used in more widely and being aware of possibilities opens my eyes.
