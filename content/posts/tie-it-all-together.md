For a long time when I was trying to learn German I couldn't make progress. I seemed to be doing well, but quickly reverted forgot everything, took long breaks, forgot everything and then would have to spend a long time relearning to get back to where I was previously. Furthermore, none of it seemed to turn itself into a useful skill.

The trick to make this work I found, was to spend a lot of time doing the activity that I was aiming for in the first place. For me, and learning languages, this starts with reading, but also includes the other cores skills of listening, writing and talking.

In short, do the thing that you want to master on a regular basis.

No matter what other drills I'm doing, if I have a foundation of reading, I know that any other drills I do will add to that overall ability eventually.
