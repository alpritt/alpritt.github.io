This is an overview of some of the stages of learning a language

## Stages

* Introduction to the language. Explore it. Learn a few words. Discover the script. Listen to it. Find out what languages it is similar to. Learn to recognise it. This can easily be done with lots of languages, because it is just about becoming familiar with it as an explorer across the spance of languages.

* Beginner course. Get to a stage where extensive study is possible without too much guidance. Read through course material intensively and listen to it. The listening is of something that is well understood.

* Extensive reading of transcribed spoken dialogue. Not pre-scripted. Ideally, at first, spoken with a beginner listener in mind. To match, as close as possible, simple interactions. Ideally, lots of material such as in a podcast so that there is plenty of material that can allow for extensive reading rather than the necessarily intensive reading from right at the beginning.

* As the reading becomes easier, add more extensive listening of material that is well understood. Read first, and listen afterwards.

* Find someone to talk to on a regular basis. Have zero expectation going into this. The previous steps will help speed up progress here, but it may feel like starting from scratch.

* Gradually increase consumption.

## Listening progression

I think it is very difficult to understand something when you don't have an extremely good grasp on the vocabulary. At the beginning of learning that will be the case, but we can get going by learning specific pieces of dialogue through an intensive study. After that I would be looking for content where 98 or ideally 99% of the words are known and the grammar is comfortable as well. I'm looking to be able to read and understand at the same pace or faster than what I have to listen to.

We can really break the listening process down, making the biggest challenge finding enough interesting content at the right level:

Steps can be missed (and should be) so that we are not wasting time doing something that is too easy.

* Listen to get a feel for the language and try to pick out a few words. I think this is hard to do for a long period of time. I can't concentrate on it. But a minute interleaved with another activity means the listening will add up.

* Read the content first so we known what it says. The better we know the content, the easier it will be to understand.

* Listen to beginner content. Ideally look for content where there are pauses that are frequent enough to allow the audio to be paused so our brain can catch up. I've found this more helpful than slowed speech although that can help too. As we get better at the language more of the words will be automatic, and so we won't need silent pauses, but rather will get gaps made out of familiar words giving our brain enough time to catch up.

* Read out loud before listening. Try to find where what we say doesn't match. If we can produce it in our own heads it is easier to hear.

* Read while listening to further support hearing.

* Listen. Pause. Try to understand what was said and then read afterwards to clarify. Then relisten and try to hear what was missed.

* Don't get stuck. Try a few times and then move on. There will likely be better opportunities to hear this word with more clarity or after the surrounding words are better understood.

* Say the sentence outloud

* If you can focus on one thing in a sentence/clause that you didn't automatically know before, that is enough progress to move on. Trying to understand 2 new things at the same time is far more difficult. Just return to it later when the first thing you learnt is more automatic.
