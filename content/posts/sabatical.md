Sabatical from Youtube and Twitter


I decided I need to take a month away from Youtube. Then I realised I need to do the same thing with Twitter.

Both of these sites are amazing resources. But also a huge distraction.

Recently I've been inspired or learnt about:

* AI that is starting to become part of some people's workflow. If I don't learn this I may be left behind.
* The Rust programming language. I haven't been this interested in learning a new language since Python which today is my favourite language and part of all of my projects.
* Some information on stretches that led to me discoving a stretch that is solving a frustrating issue I have
* DIY advice that has inspired me to make more things
* Writing advice
* Language learning advice and explanations that are having a huge impact on my study plan
* More general learning advice that has me practicing much more effective means of learning

Huge positive information and inspiration that can have a big impact on my life.

But that also makes it adictive.

I keep getting hits of great, life changing information from these places. Some of it is just entertainment which also has me coming back for more, some of it is compelling but actually makes me feel bad (such as some of the news) but I'm also getting really valuable, high quality, impactful content as well.

And that makes it hard to abandon. Not only am I emotionally attached, but I'm also logically attached to it. It doesn't make logical sense to give up this sort of thing.

The problem is one of quantity. Sometimes you have to cut out the good stuff, to see what else might flow in. I've been introduced to so much, that putting it into practice is now more important that learning what else there might be going on. I start by watching how to put up a shelf and end up thinking I should build a house.

I can get behind and catch up next month or next year or maybe in five years. A lot of the new stuff I'm learning are videos from the last few years, not days. If something is a big issue (maybe a DIY problem or I need something for work, I can specifically look that thing up, or ask someone and then shut out new inspiration again.) I want to avoid it as much as possible, but if needed I can get back to it.

Most of all, I think after a while (I'm planning a month), it will make sense to return to it to see what I missed, to get inspired again. With that thought, I've reasoned my way out of the logical addiction and now just need to go through the pain of the dopamine hit withdrawal symptoms.
