These are the resources I have used so far.

* Japanese uncovered
I've been a fan of Olly Richards for a while and have bought some of his German graded readers. For Japanese in particular I felt I need a course. This won't be good enough on its own. I found it worked well with more methodical teaching from Japanese From Zero. Something like the Genki text books would perhaps be the more obvious choice, but George is fun to listen to.

* Japanese From Zero

* Jisho dictionary
Great dictionary for translating into English.

* Learn Japanese with NORIKO (https://www.japanesewithnoriko.com/)

* "Slow Japanese" podcast by Mochifika https://mochifika.com/podcast/
This is very slowly spoken simple Japanese. I used to it after studying for a year and a half, but it would be a useful resource from much earlier. For me, I wanted to start improving my listening skills beyond the material in Japanese Uncovered. And although this was simpler than what I'd already been practicing with, it is still difficult for me because I approached it by listening before reading which was too hard for me with Japanese Uncovered at the time.

* Satari Reader https://www.satorireader.com/

This is an amazing resource of extensive reading and listening. To start with I'm just using it for reading because I'm working on my listening with simpler material as well as relistening to harder Japanese Uncovered stories.
